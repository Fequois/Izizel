        <h1>Welcome to Izizel Starter Kit</h1>

        <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
        Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live
        in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
        ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it
        with the necessary regelialia.</p>

        <h2>The Paradisematic Country</h2>

        <p>It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences
        fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about
        the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a
        small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave
        for the far World of Grammar.</p>

        <p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands
        of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the
        Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put
        her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached
        the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on
        the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
        Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.</p>

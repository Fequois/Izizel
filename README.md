# Izizel

Izizel is a basic front-end project scaffold.

## But what *is* Izizel?

Izizel is my starting point for new web projects. It is a few lines of code and a couple of libraries I always use. There are some plain ol' Jade templates with the necessary basics, a rather small collection of JavaScript libraries and a bunch of Sass files.

Izizel's Sass structure has drawn much from a talk by [Harry Roberts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4) on his *Inverted Triangle CSS* (ITCSS) methodology. This is a brief explanation of the [presentation](http://csswizardry.net/talks/2014/11/itcss-dafed.pdf):

> Managing CSS at scale is hard; and a lot harder than it should be. ITCSS is a simple, effective, and as-yet unpublished methodology to help manage, maintain, and scale CSS projects of all sizes.

I recreated a diagram of the ITCSS structure from the slides, which I think sums up the idea pretty well:

A more thorough description will come as the project evolves, if it evolves, but in the meanwhile there are some hints in `izizel.scss` on how it works.

## What Izizel *is not*

It is not a grid system, a mixin library or any other complete solution. It is not an alternative to the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) project nor is it a CMS template.

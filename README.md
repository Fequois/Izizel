[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/fequois/izizel/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/fequois/izizel#info=devDependencies)

Izizel is a front-end starter kit with a bunch opinionated defaults. Its
objective is to be a fast and flexible starting point for new web projects.

The key feature is the Sass files. Its structure is inspired by Smaccs, OOCSS
and ITCSS but with a sprinkle of personal flair.

CSS classes are named following the BEM naming convention, and Sass variables
with descriptive names. Abbreviations may be used where context clearly
describes what they are.

Izizel is a front-end starter kit with a bunch opinionated defaults. Its
objective is to be a fast, flexible starting point for new web projects.

The logic behind the Sass structure is inspired by Harry Roberts' [Inverted Triangle CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4) methodology. The diagram
below gives you an overview of how it's been implemented.

Classes are named following the BEM naming convention, and variables with a
descriptive name. Abbreviations are only allowed where context can clearly
describe what you're looking at.

It's just a starting point; you're free to do with it whatever you wish.
